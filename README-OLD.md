# CAGD 280 Fall Semester Final Project

This project is to a final for me to show what I've
learned all year and put that to a game project

This project will be recreating a 2d RPG battle
(This oldschool pokemon / earthbound games)

This project will be made in Unreal Engine

All the coding was done by me, Cai
All the sprites were made by my friend Ian,
who made them specifically for this project
and are fine with their use

All Music was made by friends exclusively for this project as well
All sound effects are free and open source and were found online.

# THIS IS FOR TESTERS / TEACHERS

Please read this for how exactly to test
all of the gameplay in this demon

NOTICE: I used a few unreal engine plugins to make
this project, so idk if you'll need to download
those to open the project in the editor??

NOTICE 2: The flee and act mechanics are not in this
since it is only a demo made to display combat function


Keybinds:
WASD to move
W/S to move up and down in action menu
Enter to interact


How to Play:
Control the character and move to the end of the platform,
get close to the enemy to initiate a battle, then
either win or die!!
